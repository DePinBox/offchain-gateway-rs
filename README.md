# Offchain Gateway (Rust)

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is under construction üöß. We are actively improving it hackathon-style.

This is a Rust implementation of the CCIP gateway. It allows you to issue unlimited gasless subdomains for your name, as well as to create, manage, and moderate namespaces.

> [!NOTE]
> This gateway is built to be an **Opinionated ENS Subname Issuer**, if youre looking for something more generic, please checkout [ccip-gateway], and [].

## Features

- CCIP Spec Compliant Gateway Endpoint
- `postgres` - Transparent Database backend
- `selfservice` - Enabled self-service for updating records

## Setup

### Run the gateway
The gateway is just a docker container / standalone binary. You can run it with docker-compose or just run the binary.

todo: running the gateway

### Deploy a Resolver

Using a CCIP Gateway requires a resolver contract to be acting on behalf of the name. Although you could write your own contract, we recommend you deploy a proxy contract through [ccip.tools](https://ccip.tools/).

(Source for the contracts can be found at [ensdomains/ccip-tools](https://github.com/ensdomains/ccip-tools/tree/master/contracts))

When asked for the `Gateway URL` supply your gateway's url (for eg: `https://gateway.example.com/{sender}.json`), and for the `Signers` field supply the address of your gateway (for eg: `[0x225f137127d9067788314bc7fcc1f36746a3c3B5]`), you can find this in the logs of your gateway.

> [!NOTE]
> There are gas costs associated with deploying a resolver, at the time of writing this (30 gwei), it costs ~0.004 ETH (8 USD) to deploy a resolver (see [txs](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0c90da0a122f38125a8ad1f48ef23cf5f7d399846bd5369b664ff288a31f797c)).

### Set your Resolver

Finally you need to instruct the onchain registry to use your resolver. You can do this by visiting your name in the [ENS Manager App](https://ens.app/) and under the `More` tab, set the `Resolver` field to the address of your resolver.
